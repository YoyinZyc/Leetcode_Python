What is the minimum (exact) number of multiplications and additions needed to evaluate an
arbitrary N-degree, one-variable polynomial with integer coefficients?
38. Give a linear-time algorithm that for a sequence of N integers, finds the contiguous subsequence
with the largest possible sum.
39. Give an O(N log K)-time algorithm to merge K given sorted lists into a single sorted list, where
N is the total number of items in all the lists.
40. Consider the following code for randomly permuting an array A of size N:
For i = 1 to N Do Swap(A[i], A[Random(1,N)])
where Random(i,j) returns a random integer uniformly distributed in the range i through j, inclusive.
a) Prove that in general, not all permutations are equally probable here.
b) Give an alternate random permuter without this flaw.
